Yes, but back to the Novae CPU diagnostics topic here, since you're well-engaged in this topic, I'd like to give you an assignment:  Check out these two schematics:  

1)  https://github.com/ForgottenMachines/Data-General-Nova/blob/main/Quantx-DG-Nova-1200-CPU/DG%20Nova%201200%20CPU.kicad_sch

2)  https://github.com/ForgottenMachines/Data-General-Nova/blob/main/Quantx-DG-Nova-1200-CPU/DG%20Nova%201200%20CPU%20-%20CON_RQ%20to%20CON_INST%20extract.kicad_sch

Schematic 2 is extracted from schematic 1, to try to simplify the task at hand.

In order for the CPU to respond to most switches on the front panel, say for example "Examine", the front panel makes CON_RQ low.  In response, a CPU would respond by making CON_INST low, which does other things we can get to later.  But for now, a healthy CPU's response to CON_RQ input is a CON_INST output.  

so, what's wrong when this fails to happen?  Well, I've tried to isolate
